# IMFLIX 
## Created by Martin Balke 

IMFLIX is a search aggregator powered by open source API's TMDB and UNONGS. 

This app allows you to search the UNONGS netflix database and then see the TMBD imdb results for a show you are interested in. Users can then save this data in to their favorites as a watch later list of shows they are interested in. 

To run as a DEV you will need to have postgress installed on your machine, you will also need to set up a .env with a UNONGS API key.
